# BTK Academy Python Machine Learning Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the BTK Academy Python Machine Learning Workshop. In this repository, you will find the code examples covered during the workshop.

## Overview

- This repository contains the Python code discussed in the BTK Academy's machine learning workshop.
- The workshop is conducted in Turkish; however, I have made an effort to document the code in English to make it more accessible to a wider audience.
